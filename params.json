Read on and find out..\r\n\r\n##Automatic builds?\r\n\r\nYou know, laziness makes a good programmer. The system is set up with a script that builds the whole project.\r\n\r\n##They just love testing!\r\n\r\nWhen the build script is run, all sorts of tests follow (\"is the grid correct?\", \"is the player allowed to do that?\"). Lovely stuff!\r\n\r\n##Always running\r\n\r\nThe newest version of the game is always available. Just head out to www.example.com and check it out. Their automatic build never fails to amaze.\r\n\r\n##The coolest strategy\r\n\r\nIt's modern, it's agile and it's fun. The Test Driven Development is the process that the Swagfish dedicate their work to. When there's a new feature, it will be managed on a new feature branch and everything is protected. (The code is loosely coupled and follows good object oriented design practices)\r\n\r\n##Continuously awesome\r\n\r\nIf you weren't impressed yet, this is the part where you get blown away. [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/swagfish/tictactoe/) makes sure all code is integrated into a shared repository and everything is kept track of.",
