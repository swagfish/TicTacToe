<a id="the-project" class="anchor" href="#the-project" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Project</h2>

<p>The team of Swagfish are developing a huge video game (the next big thing) in the most fashionable way there is! How do they do it? Read on and find out..</p>

<h2>
<a id="automatic-builds" class="anchor" href="#automatic-builds" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Automatic builds?</h2>

<p>You know, laziness makes a good programmer. The system is set up with a script that builds the whole project.</p>

<h2>
<a id="they-just-love-testing" class="anchor" href="#they-just-love-testing" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>They just love testing!</h2>

<p>When the build script is run, all sorts of tests follow ("is the grid correct?", "is the player allowed to do that?"). Lovely stuff!</p>

<h2>
<a id="always-running" class="anchor" href="#always-running" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Always running</h2>

<p>The newest version of the game is always available. Just head out to <a href="http://www.example.com">www.example.com</a> and check it out. Their automatic build never fails to amaze.</p>

<h2>
<a id="the-coolest-strategy" class="anchor" href="#the-coolest-strategy" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The coolest strategy</h2>

<p>It's modern, it's agile and it's fun. The Test Driven Development is the process that the Swagfish dedicate their work to. When there's a new feature, it will be managed on a new feature branch and everything is protected. (The code is loosely coupled and follows good object oriented design practices)</p>

<h2>
<a id="continuously-awesome" class="anchor" href="#continuously-awesome" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Continuously awesome</h2>

<p>If you weren't impressed yet, this is the part where you get blown away. <a href="https://travis-ci.org/swagfish/tictactoe/">Travis</a> makes sure all code is integrated into a shared repository and everything is kept track of.</p>
