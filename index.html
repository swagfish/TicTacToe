<a id="the-project" class="anchor" href="#the-project" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Project</h2>

<p>We, team Swagfish, are developing a web application game called TicTacToe however the main focus on this project
is not the programming behind it, but the development behind it and to learn how to set up technical infrastructures
that supports agile development.</p>

<h2>
<a id="always-running" class="anchor" href="#always-running" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The game</h2>

<p>The game itself is a simple TicTacToe. It's a two player game, X and O, and the main focus is to place three marks in a row. The newest version of the game is always available. Just head out to <a href="https://arcane-tundra-47758.herokuapp.com/">TicTacToe</a> and check it out.

<h2>
<a id="automatic-builds" class="anchor" href="#automatic-builds" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Gradle</h2>

<p> The project is also run with an open source build automation system called gradle. With gradle you can easily run scripts that allows you for example, compile your code
create a runnable Jar file or even run unit tests. It can be a little bit hard to set up gradle and getting used to it, but once that part is over it makes things much easier.</p>

<h2>
<a id="continuously-awesome" class="anchor" href="#continuously-awesome" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Travis CI</h2>
<p>The project also uses <a href="https://travis-ci.org/swagfish/TicTacToe/">Travis CI</a>, which is a continuous integration service used to build and test projects at GitHub. Travis
automatically detects when a commit has been made and pushed to a GitHub repository that is using Travis. Each time that happens, it builds the project and runs all tests.</p>

<h2>
<a id="continuously-awesome" class="anchor" href="#continuously-awesome" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Heroku</h2>
<p>The project also uses a cloud platform called <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. Heroku allows us to build, delived
and monitor our project and to run in on the web so everyone can enjoy it.</p>


<h2>
<a id="the-coolest-strategy" class="anchor" href="#the-coolest-strategy" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Test Driven Development</h2>

<p>The Test Driven Development is the process that the Swagfish dedicate their work to. When there's a new feature, it will be managed on a new feature branch and everything is protected. Whenever we finish a new feature, we push it to a developer branch,
and from there, only one person has the right to push it to the master branch. (The code is loosely coupled and follows good object oriented design practices)</p>
